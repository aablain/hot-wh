            <h3>Rheem High Efficiency Water Heater </h3>
            <p>Electric Hot Water Heaters and Gas Hot Water Heaters provide a large volume of dependable, low-cost hot water. Fuel sources can be propane, natural gas or electricity. They are the most common way to heat water in the United States.</p>
            <p>Residential tank water heaters typically store between 20 and 80 gallons of hot water hot  throughout, usually at the factory setting of 120°F. The temperature can be adjusted up or down by a control on the unit. Tank water heaters are typically located in the garage, basement or attic.</p>
            <p>Upgrading a standard 5' x 9' bathroom to a master suite or an in-home spa may require upgrading to a larger gallon capacity unit, especially if the new bathroom will include a deep soaking tub with a multi-head shower system. Replacing a tank water heater with another tank water heater is fast and keeps labor costs to a minimum.</p>

            <h3>Tankless Water Heaters</h3>
            <p>Tankless water heaters are today's most popular "green" hot water solution, with the added benefit of actually enhancing the clients' experiences in a luxury bathroom. No matter how many body sprays and showerheads, no matter how deep the whirlpool, your clients will not run out of hot water with a properly sized tankless water heating system.</p>
            <p>Tankless gas water heaters are more energy-efficient than conventional tank heaters, because they eliminate the need to maintain a large supply of pre-heated water. Tankless units provide hot water on demand at a precise temperature needed, so there is no storage and therefore no need to expend energy heating that stored water.    Delays in hot water delivery have to do with where the water heater is located, not the type of water heater.</p>

      <h2>Warranties</h2>
      <h3>6-Year Warranty Rheem Water Heater</h3>
      <p>6-year warranty water heaters are the basic-level series for Rheem. These are fantastic water heaters, but they do require annual maintenance to drain the tank. This prevents harmful mineral deposits from forming and cracking the glass lining of the storage tank.</p>
      <p>These Rheem water heaters come with a 6-year warranty on parts & tank, and a 1-year warranty on labor. The 6-year warranty does not means the unit will only last that long: your water heater, if properly maintained, should have a life-span of at least 8 years.</p>
      <h3>10-Year Warranty Rheem Water Heater</h3>
      <p>The 10-year warranty water heaters from Rheem are a step-up. These water heaters are self-cleaning, which means the unit moves water around the tank to prevent mineral deposits from forming quickly. Additionally, these water heaters are slightly more energy efficient, which will mitigate your energy expenses.</p>
      <p>Rheem 10-year warranty hot water heaters from Fast Water Heater Company come with a 10-year warranty on parts & tank, and a 1-year labor warranty. This is a very popular series because life expectancy of a water heater is around ten years, so the warranty covers most of a heater’s usable life.</p>
      <h3>15-Year Warranty Rheem Water Heater</h3>
      <p>Rheem 15-year warranty water heaters are the top-of-the-line units sold for residential applications. With higher energy efficiency, metal & brass parts, the self-cleaning feature and an additional anode rod for corrosion prevention, these water heaters offer unmatched performance.</p>
      <p>Rheem 15-year warranty water heaters are top-of-the-line units sold for residential applications. These units come with a second anode rod installed. Anode rods work by preventing corrosion and cracks to the glass lining in your hot water tank by attracting harmful minerals in the water.</p>
      <p>These hot water heaters come with a 15-year warranty on parts & tank, and a 1-year, industry leading labor warranty. The warranty is not prorated either, so if your tank fails after 14 years, you will get a brand new one for free.</p>
      <h3>Energy Star</h3>
      <p>Starting in 2015, all residential water heaters are required to be Energy Star certified. The Rheem Energy Star water heaters we carry offer superior efficiency than standard units and should save you money on your energy bills annually. They achieve this through the use of an electric ignition and damper. Instead of a burner heating the water constantly, the electric burner assembly kicks in when it is needed.</p>
      <p>One thing to note, though; Energy Star water heaters must be plugged into an electrical outlet. They have a long cord, but you must have an electrical outlet within 15-feet of the unit. Also, if you lose electricity during a power outage, the unit will not be able to heat your water. But once power is restored, the unit will automatically start working again.</p>
